# Odin Pong

I wanted to learn a new language and the result is this pong game
coded with [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) + [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
Odin is like C, but simpler, fast and painless to compile, I like it!.
It's been a while since I coded in something like pure C so it's a
bit of a mess but it works, baby! ðŸ˜Ž.

## Features

- Play solo against a dumb AI or some puny human.
- Simple controls lol just two keys per player.
- Nostalgic HD sound effects.
- Epic background music.

## How to run

After installing Odin in your system, clone this repo, get inside and do:
```bash
odin run .
```
Developed and tested on Windows 10, but it should work on any platform that supports Odin and Raylib.
